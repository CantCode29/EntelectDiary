Today was the first day of boot camp. The entire day was spent getting to know the Entelect team and seniors and we were given a rough explanation of how the boot camp is going to run. We were in the Venue at Rosebank for the entire day. It was a chilled day filled with useful information, and introductions to the 74 other graduates. Tomorrow the bootcamp work officially starts.
